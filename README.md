-- **Abstract: ** Substantial reduction of methane emissions is the fastest way to repress near-term warming and an essential prerequisite for reaching the 1.5ËšC target. However, the global innovative trend, sectoral and national distribution, and international transfer of methane abatement technologies are rarely known. By integrating potential emission reduction pathways with the EPO Y02 scheme, we identify nearly one fifth of a million methane-targeted abatement technology (MTAT) inventions patented during 1990-2019 by 133 countries or dependent territories. Our analyses find that after a sustained growth by more than fourfold from 1990 to 2010, the number of high-quality MTAT inventions and their share in overall patented inventions present a decline trend, by 3.5% and 6.8% annually respectively, from 2010 to 2019. The sectoral and national-level distributions of MTAT inventions and methane emissions are badly mismatched. MTAT inventions are heavily concentrated in the waste treatment sector and at a few developed countries with China, yet the majority of future methane emission growths are set to occur from the agricultural sector and developing and least developed countries. Moreover, current international diffusion of MTATs is lower by eleven percents relative to the average of climate change mitigation technologies, and most transfers happen between developed countries or flow into China, South Korea, and Brazil, yet other developing countries and least developed countries are rarely involved.
