- ** Title: ** Global invention trend of methane abatement technologies and widening mismatch with methane emissions

- ** Abstract: ** A substantial reduction in methane emissions is the fastest way to repress near-term warming and an essential prerequisite for reaching the 1.5 °C target. However, the global invention trend, sectoral and national distribution, and international diffusion of methane-targeted abatement technologies (MTATs) are rarely known. By integrating potential methane reduction pathways with the European Patent Office’s Y02 scheme customized for climate-friendly technologies, we identify more than 175 thousand MTAT inventions patented during the 1990–2019 period by 133 countries or dependent territories. Our analysis reveals that after sustained growth by more than fourfold from 1990 to 2010, the quantity of high-quality MTAT inventions and their portion in overall patented inventions show declining trends, by 3.5% and 6.8% annually respectively, from 2010 to 2019. The sectoral and national-level distributions of MTAT inventions and methane emissions are seriously mismatched. MTAT inventions have heavily and increasingly concentrated in the waste treatment sector and a few developed countries together with China and South Korea, yet the majority of future emission growth are set to occur from the agricultural sector, emerging economies and least developed countries. Additionally, the international diffusion of MTATs is 11.1% lower than that of overall climate change mitigation technologies, and most transfers happen among developed countries or flow to China, South Korea, and Brazil, while other developing countries and the least developed countries are rarely involved. .
