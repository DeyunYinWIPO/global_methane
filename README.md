- **Title:** Global trend of methane abatement inventions and widening mismatch with methane emissions

- **Abstract:** Substantially reducing methane emissions is the fastest way to repress near-term warming and is an essential prerequisite for reaching the 1.5Â°C target. However, knowledge about the global invention trend, sectoral and national distribution, and international diffusion of methane-targeted abatement technologies (MTATs) remains limited. Based on patent data, we identify more than 175 thousand MTAT inventions applied between 1990 and 2019 by 133 countries or dependent territories. Our results revealed that after sustained growth of more than fourfold, the number of global high-quality MTAT inventions declined by 3.5% annually from 2010 to 2019. The sectoral and national-level distributions of MTAT inventions and methane emissions are strongly mismatched. Additionally, the international diffusion of MTATs is 11.1% lower than that of overall climate change mitigation technologies, and most transfers occur between developed countries or flow to China, South Korea, and Brazil; however, other developing countries and the least developed countries are rarely involved.
